PostgreSQL Date/Time Fundamentals + Retail Sales Analysis
Author: Teslim Adeyanju
Dialect: PostgreSQL 12+ (tested on 15/16)
Purpose: Handy reference for date/timestamp functions, date/time arithmetic,
         formatting, and retail_sales analytics with GROUP BY + window functions.

-- ============================================================================
-- 1) CURRENT DATE/TIME
-- ============================================================================

-- Current date (DATE)
SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date;

-- Local timestamp (TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE)
SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP AS local_ts;

-- Current timestamp (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS current_timestamptz;

-- NOW() is equivalent to current_timestamp in Postgres
SELECT NOW() AS now_timestamptz;

-- Current time (TIME WITHOUT TIME ZONE)
SELECT CURRENT_TIME AS current_time;

-- Local time (TIME WITHOUT TIME ZONE)
SELECT LOCALTIME AS local_time;


-- ============================================================================
-- 2) TRUNCATING TIMESTAMPS
--    NOTE: date_trunc returns TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ at the chosen precision.
--    Week truncation uses Monday as the first day of the week in Postgres.
-- ============================================================================

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', TIMESTAMP '2025-08-22 22:19:58') AS trunc_year;
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',  TIMESTAMP '2025-08-22 22:19:58') AS trunc_day;
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', TIMESTAMP '2025-08-22 22:19:58') AS trunc_hour;
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', TIMESTAMP '2025-08-22 22:19:58') AS trunc_week;


-- ============================================================================
-- 3) EXTRACTING PARTS FROM TIMESTAMP
--    date_part(text, timestamp) and EXTRACT(field FROM source) are equivalent.
--    Prefer EXTRACT for ANSI-like syntax. Field names are typically singular.
-- ============================================================================

-- Using date_part (returns DOUBLE PRECISION)
SELECT DATE_PART('day',   CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)  AS day_of_month;
SELECT DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)  AS month_of_year;
SELECT DATE_PART('year',  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)  AS year_number;

-- Using EXTRACT
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY   FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS day_of_month_v2;
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR  FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS hour_of_day;


-- ============================================================================
-- 4) HUMAN-READABLE FORMATTING (to_char)
--    See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html
--    'Day'/'Month' (capitalized) give capitalized names; 'day'/'month' are padded.
-- ============================================================================

SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Day')   AS day_name;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Month') AS month_name;


-- ============================================================================
-- 5) CONSTRUCTING / PARSING DATES
-- ============================================================================

-- Construct a DATE directly
SELECT MAKE_DATE(1977, 10, 26) AS birthday;

-- Parse a string into DATE with to_date (be explicit with the format mask)
SELECT TO_DATE(CONCAT('2020','-','09','-','01'), 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS parsed_date;


-- ============================================================================
-- 6) DATE ARITHMETIC
--    date - date = INTEGER (days)
--    AGE(later, earlier) = INTERVAL (years-months-days)
-- ============================================================================

-- Days between two dates (negative means the left is earlier than the right)
SELECT DATE '1977-10-26' - DATE '2025-08-26' AS days_diff_1;
SELECT DATE '2025-08-01' - DATE '2025-08-26' AS days_diff_2;
SELECT DATE '2025-08-26' - DATE '2025-08-01' AS days_diff_3;

-- AGE() returns an INTERVAL (years mons days) between two dates/timestamps
SELECT AGE(DATE '2020-05-31', DATE '2020-06-30') AS age_interval_1;
SELECT AGE(DATE '2025-10-25', DATE '1977-10-26') AS age_interval_2;

-- Extract parts from AGE() (use singular fields: year, month, day)
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM AGE(DATE '2025-10-25', DATE '1977-10-26')) AS years_part,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(DATE '2025-10-25', DATE '1977-10-26')) AS months_part,
    EXTRACT(DAY   FROM AGE(DATE '2025-10-25', DATE '1977-10-26')) AS days_part;

-- Add an INTERVAL to a DATE
SELECT DATE '1977-10-26' + INTERVAL '48 years' AS plus_48_years;


-- ============================================================================
-- 7) TIME ARITHMETIC
--    You can add/subtract INTERVALs to/from TIME values.
--    NOTE: Multiplying a TIME by a number is NOT valid; multiply the INTERVAL.
-- ============================================================================

-- Add/subtract hours
SELECT TIME '05:00' + INTERVAL '3 hours' AS time_plus_3h;
SELECT TIME '05:00' - INTERVAL '3 hours' AS time_minus_3h;

-- Multiply an INTERVAL (result stays INTERVAL), then add to TIME if needed
SELECT INTERVAL '1 second' * 2000 AS interval_multiplied;           -- 2000 seconds
SELECT TIME '05:00' + (INTERVAL '1 hour' * 2) AS time_plus_2h;      -- 07:00


-- ============================================================================
-- 8) RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS
--    Table: retail_sales(sales_month DATE, kind_of_business TEXT, sales NUMERIC/DECIMAL)
--    Tips:
--      * Always add ORDER BY in analytics outputs for readability.
--      * Cast to NUMERIC/DECIMAL in pct calcs to avoid integer division.
-- ============================================================================
